Enhanced Text (AI-generated details):
${enhancedText}

Original Text (user input):
${experienceText}

Extract and structure the information. Use the enhanced text for detailed responsibilities but prioritize the original text for factual information like job title, company, dates, and location.

CRITICAL: 
- Extract job title and company name from original text
- Use enhanced text for comprehensive responsibilities section
- Format responsibilities as multiple bullet points with line breaks
- Each responsibility should start with "‚Ä¢ " and be on a new line
- Include all the detailed achievements and responsibilities from the enhanced text
- The responsibilities field should contain MINIMUM 10 bullet points
- Each bullet point should be detailed and specific
- Cover different aspects: technical skills, leadership, collaboration, problem-solving, achievements, tools, methodologies
- EXTRACT ALL SKILLS: Extract all technical skills, programming languages, frameworks, tools, methodologies, databases, cloud platforms, etc. mentioned or implied
- Skills should include both explicit mentions and implied skills based on the role and responsibilities
- The responsibilities field should look like: "‚Ä¢ First responsibility\n‚Ä¢ Second responsibility\n‚Ä¢ Third responsibility\n‚Ä¢ Fourth responsibility\n‚Ä¢ Fifth responsibility\n‚Ä¢ Sixth responsibility\n‚Ä¢ Seventh responsibility\n‚Ä¢ Eighth responsibility\n‚Ä¢ Ninth responsibility\n‚Ä¢ Tenth responsibility"

EXAMPLE RESPONSIBILITIES FORMAT (MINIMUM 10 POINTS):
"‚Ä¢ Led development team of 5 engineers in designing scalable microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes\n‚Ä¢ Implemented CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitLab reducing deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes\n‚Ä¢ Optimized database queries and indexing strategies resulting in 40% performance improvement\n‚Ä¢ Mentored 3 junior developers through code reviews, pair programming, and technical guidance\n‚Ä¢ Collaborated with product team to define technical requirements and sprint planning\n‚Ä¢ Designed and implemented RESTful APIs serving 10,000+ concurrent users\n‚Ä¢ Established coding standards and best practices improving code quality by 35%\n‚Ä¢ Implemented automated testing frameworks achieving 90% code coverage\n‚Ä¢ Led incident response and troubleshooting for production systems with 99.9% uptime\n‚Ä¢ Conducted technical interviews and participated in hiring decisions for engineering team\n‚Ä¢ Researched and evaluated new technologies leading to adoption of React and Node.js\n‚Ä¢ Implemented security measures including OAuth 2.0 and data encryption protocols"
